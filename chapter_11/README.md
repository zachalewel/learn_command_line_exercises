1)Can you rename foo.txt to blah.txt?

#####yes to do that I would run `mv foo.txt blah.txt`

2)Can you move the production.log file in the log directory to slash temp?

I dont have it so here is how I would make it. 

#####in the chapter_11 directory I would `mkdir log` then `touch production.log` then finally `mv production.log log`
