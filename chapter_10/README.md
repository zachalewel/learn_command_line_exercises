3) Explain what robocopy is.
 
######In my own words it seems like a tool to copy things while keeping permissions and timestamps
  
  and not in my words
  
######"Unlike normal copy commands, Robocopy is designed for reliable copy or mirroring while
######maintaining the permissions, attributes, owner information, timestamps and properties of the
######objects copied."
