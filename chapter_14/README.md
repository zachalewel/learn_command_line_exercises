rm -rf / recursively deletes everything and can't be undone and it does not ask "are you sure?"


1) Can you remove blah.txt?

Yeah sure, to do that I would run `rm blah.txt` 

2) Let's get rid of our development log file.

ok, to do that I would run `rm development.log` 

3) Can you remove everything in the slash temp slash foo directory?

yes by running `rm -rf ~/tmp/foo` you will delete temp but also everything in temp
