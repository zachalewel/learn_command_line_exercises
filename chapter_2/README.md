###pwd-print working directory###
####The finder is a way to very quickly find, move, copy, open, explore directories####
####So to find your path with finder you simply `âŒ˜ spacebar` ->finder ->enter####
####What you will see two vertical columns, the one on the left contains the Favorites,####
####the column on the right will be the current navigation. That will tell you where you are at.####
####In order to find out the full path you would right click and select get info.####
####Then under "where" is your current location.####

1) What directory are you in?

**To find this out I would run, `pwd`.
this would tell me I am in
/Users/zachalewel/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2**

2) Are you in the class directory?

**Yes, I am in the classes directory, workspace/davinci_coders/bu... is
our class directory.**

3) Are you in your home directory?

**Yes, my class directory is within my home directory. If you notice
when you run `pwd` that you are under /Users/name**

4) What directory did you run that command in?
 
**Again I found this out using `pwd`.
/Users/zachalewel/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2**

#####The other way to find out is in terminal you just simply type pwd, which stands for print#####
#####current working directory. Which I will demonstrate for you now about 40 or 50 times.#####
