  ###pwd-print working directory###
####The finder is a way to very quickly find, move, copy, open, explore directories####
####So to find your path with finder you simply `âŒ˜ spacebar` ->finder ->enter####
####What you will see two vertical columns, the one on the left contains the Favorites,####
####the column on the right will be the current navigation. That will tell you where you are at.####
####In order to find out the full path you would right click and select get info.####
####Then under "where" is your current location.####

##The other way to find out is in terminal you just simply type pwd, which stands for print##
##current working directory. Which I will demonstrate for you now about 40 or 50 times.##
