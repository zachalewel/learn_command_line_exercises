Show me the lines in foo.txt that have "ERROR" in them.

`grep ERROR *.txt`

Show me the lines in bar.txt that have "davinci" in them.

`grep davinci *.txt`

Can you print all the lines in text files that have your first and last name in them?
`(master) Zach Alewel
Zachs-MacBook-Pro:davinci_coders_t3_2015 $ grep Zach Alewel *.txt
my_name.txt:Zach Alewel`
