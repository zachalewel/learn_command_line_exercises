#####The command `pushd` I would assume is useful, say if I wanted to copy a file into the directory I was in
#####I could `pushd` to take a snapshot of where I am and then go to the file I want, copy it and run
#####`popd` to come back to the directory you to a snapshot of to quickly paste it.

#####Or maybe if I was working in the directory associated with my origin repo, and I wanted to clone a repo I forked in a
#####different directory, knowing I would come right back to my origin repo directory I could `pushd` in my origin
#####then move around to the directory I wanted to clone the fork in clone it and `popd` right back.
