1) Can you make a temp directory?

**Yes, to do this run the make directory command `mkdir <filename>`
the output is a directory being made within whatever directory you are in**

2) Can you make a log directory in your class directory?

**Yes to do this I would `cd ..` until I got to the class directory (using pwd to verify)
then when I was in davinci_coders_t3_2015 I would run `mkdir log`. Using `ls -l` to confirm it's there**
